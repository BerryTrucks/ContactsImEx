Import and export contacts in CSV or VCF format.

ContactsImEx is a handy tool that helps you to import and export your contacts data from and to either a CSV (comma separated values) or vCard (*.vcf) format file.

Features:
- Import contacts from vCard format version 3.0 (including contact photos).
- Export contacts to vCard format version 3.0 (including contact photos).
- Import contacts from CSV file with very flexible column configuration.
- Export full contacts to CSV file (no contact photos).

The CSV format uses comma, double quotes, and backslash as special characters for field separator, quotation, escaping, respectively. Newlines are exported as '\n'. The first line is considered a header record containing the field names.

CSV format example records are:
Field 1,Field 2,Field 3
Field 1,"Field 2, with comma",Field 3
Field 1,Field 2 with \"quotes\",Field 3
Field 1,Field 2 with embedded \n new line,Field 3
Field 1,Field 2 with embedded \\,Field 3

For the field names the so-called attribute kind and subkind names joined with a slash (/) from the Blackberry OS Contacts API are used. Typical field names are: Name/NameGiven, Name/NameSurname, Phone/Home, Phone/Work, Phone/PhoneMobile, Email/Home, Email/Work, PostalAddressLine1/Home, PostalAddressLine1/Home, PostalAddressLine2/Home, PostalAddressCity/Home, PostalAddressCode/Home, PostalAddressCountry/Home.
